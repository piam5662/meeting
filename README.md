# Meeting Management Application

This application utilizes the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern to manage meetings effectively.

## MVC Overview

MVC, or Model-View-Controller, is a software architectural pattern commonly used in the development of web applications. It divides the application into three interconnected components: the Model, the View, and the Controller.

### Model

The Model component includes classes representing meetings, users, and any other relevant entities. Methods within these classes handle tasks such as creating new meetings, retrieving meeting details, updating meeting information, and deleting meetings.

For instance, we might have a Meeting class with methods like `createMeeting()`, `getMeetingDetails()`, `updateMeeting()`, and `deleteMeeting()`.

### View

The View component consists of HTML templates and CSS stylesheets for displaying various aspects of the application's user interface. Templates are designed to show meeting details, list all meetings, create new meetings, and possibly edit existing meetings.

For example, we could have templates for creating a new meeting, displaying a list of meetings, and showing details of a specific meeting.

### Controller

The Controller component handles incoming requests from users, processes them, interacts with the Model to perform necessary actions, and then renders the appropriate View. It contains methods corresponding to different actions users can perform in the application, such as creating a new meeting, viewing meeting details, updating a meeting, or deleting a meeting.

These methods orchestrate the flow of data between the Model and the View, ensuring that the user's request is handled correctly.

For instance, we might have a MeetingController with methods like `create()`, `show()`, `edit()`, `update()`, and `destroy()` to handle various user actions related to meetings.

## Usage

- **Model**: Manages data related to meetings, users, etc., and provides methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on this data.
- **View**: Renders HTML templates to present meeting-related information to users and receives user input for creating, updating, or deleting meetings.
- **Controller**: Receives user requests, processes them, interacts with the Model to perform necessary operations on meeting data, and then returns the appropriate View to the user.
